## Keeloq encryption algorithm    
This implementations might be useful if you are playing around with [Microchip Keeloq](http://www.microchip.com/pagehandler/en-us/technology/embeddedsecurity/technology/keeloqencoderdl.html) chips.    
I verified that this algorithm gives the same results as that produced by the Microchip SDK for several test cases.      
The Keeloq algorithm is not patented.       
However, since Microchip does hold a patent on its application to secure keyless entry,
it probably would not be wise to make a commercial secure keyless entry product using this algorithm in a non-Microchip processor.     
Personal experimentation should be okay.      
    
__If you decide to make something commercial, buy Microchip's processors.__
